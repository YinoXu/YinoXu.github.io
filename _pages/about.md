I am a first-year Master's student in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My research focuses on improving AI by addressing biases and logical inconsistencies, with the goal of making AI systems more human-like in their reasoning and decision-making. I am particularly interested in enhancing AIâ€™s understanding of the world and its ability to provide ethically sound and context-aware solutions. Additionally, I am passionate about biomedical image segmentation, especially improving accuracy in segmenting small abdominal organs, which is crucial for increasing the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications. I aspire to advance AI research, refining systems to not only perform effectively but also think critically and ethically, with impactful real-world applications in healthcare and beyond.

I am excited to further contribute to these areas through a Ph.D. program, with the aim of refining AI ystems to not only perform effectively but also think critically and ethically.

I was a member of [NYU Women in Science (Wins)](https://cas.nyu.edu/wins.html), a program recognizing undergraduate scholars for academic achievement and commitment to STEM inclusivity.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nan Xu](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/nan-xu) from [NYU Shanghai](https://econ.shanghai.nyu.edu/) as a Research Assistant, focusing on the dynamics of CUSMA trading. Additionally, I was advised by [Dr. Terrance Chen](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/chen--terrence.html) from the [NYU Department of Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology.html), where I investigated the evolution and impact of ideological terms within the media. Furthermore, under the guidance of [Dr. Jake Hofman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jmh/), I collaborated with scientists at the [Microsoft Research Lab in New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/) to apply machine learning techniques to assess CitiBike's impact on NYC. Most recently, at Capital Normal University, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Hongxiao Wang](https://ams.cnu.edu.cn/english/People/Faculty/ac9b3be8d87a449a963c1d6171def754.htm), where my research focused on enhancing segmentation accuracy for small abdominal organs using machine learning models.

Eager to connect with professionals and peers in technology, research, and innovation, I welcome opportunities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Feel free to connect!

I am eager to find a Research Assistant position in the field of NLP, ML, or other related areas. Please feel free to contact me: [xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu](javascript:copyToClipboard('xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu')).
