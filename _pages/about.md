I'm a Master's student in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My primary research interest lies at the intersection of AI and law, focusing on AIâ€™s implications in the legal field, particularly in automatic generation techniques. Additionally, I am interested in Model Prompt Optimization in Biological Imaging.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nan Xu](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/nan-xu) from [NYU Shanghai](https://econ.shanghai.nyu.edu/) as a Research Assistant, focusing on the dynamics of CUSMA trading. Additionally, I was advised by [Dr. Terrance Chen](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/chen--terrence.html) from the [NYU Department of Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology.html) as a Research Assistant, investigating the evolution and impact of ideological terms within the media.

Eager to connect with professionals and peers in technology, research, and innovation, I welcome opportunities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Feel free to connect!

I am eager to find a Research Assistant position in the field of NLP, ML, or other related areas. Please feel free to contact me: [xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu](javascript:copyToClipboard('xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu')).
