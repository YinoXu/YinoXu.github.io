I am a first-year Master's student in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My research focuses on advancing AI for medical applications, particularly in pathology, with the goal of assisting doctors and clinicians in improving diagnostic precision. My work spans multiple areas, including leveraging computer vision to enhance segmentation and classification in medical imaging. Beyond technical performance, I am dedicated to refining AI systems to not only function effectively but also reason critically and ethically, ensuring their impact extends meaningfully to real-world healthcare applications and beyond.

I am eager to further contribute to these areas through a Ph.D. program, where I aim to develop AI models that are not only more precise but also more interpretable, robust, and aligned with ethical considerations in healthcare.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Zhi Huang](https://www.zhihuang.ai/) as a research assistant at [Perelman School of Medicine at Upenn](https://www.med.upenn.edu/), where my work primarily focuses on innovating AI/ML models for medical image analysis. My research involves developing and optimizing algorithms and intelligent agents to improve cell nuclei-based segmentation and classification, ultimately enhancing automated pathology workflows.

I was a member of [NYU Women in Science (Wins)](https://cas.nyu.edu/wins.html), a program recognizing undergraduate scholars for academic achievement and commitment to STEM inclusivity.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nan Xu](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/nan-xu) from [NYU Shanghai](https://econ.shanghai.nyu.edu/) as a Research Assistant, focusing on the dynamics of CUSMA trading. Additionally, I was advised by [Dr. Terrance Chen](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/chen--terrence.html) from the [NYU Department of Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology.html), where I investigated the evolution and impact of ideological terms within the media. Furthermore, under the guidance of [Dr. Jake Hofman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jmh/), I collaborated with scientists at the [Microsoft Research Lab in New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/) to apply machine learning techniques to assess CitiBike's impact on NYC. Most recently, at Capital Normal University, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Hongxiao Wang](https://ams.cnu.edu.cn/english/People/Faculty/ac9b3be8d87a449a963c1d6171def754.htm), where my research focused on enhancing segmentation accuracy for small abdominal organs using machine learning models.

Eager to connect with professionals and peers in technology, research, and innovation, I welcome opportunities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Feel free to connect!
