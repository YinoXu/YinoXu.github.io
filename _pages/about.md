I'm a Master's student in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My primary research interests lie at the intersection of AI and law, focusing on AI’s implications in the legal field, particularly in automatic generation techniques. Additionally, I am interested in computer-assisted diagnosis, particularly in enhancing segmentation accuracy for small abdominal organs using machine learning models. I am also focused on improving model differentiation between small organs and adjacent structures to increase clinical application reliability.

I was a member of [NYU Women in Science (Wins)](https://cas.nyu.edu/wins.html), a program recognizing undergraduate scholars for academic achievement and commitment to STEM inclusivity.

Here’s how you can phrase this based on your experiences:

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nan Xu](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/nan-xu) from [NYU Shanghai](https://econ.shanghai.nyu.edu/) as a Research Assistant, focusing on the dynamics of CUSMA trading. Additionally, I was advised by [Dr. Terrance Chen](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/chen--terrence.html) from the [NYU Department of Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology.html), where I investigated the evolution and impact of ideological terms within the media. Furthermore, under the guidance of [Dr. Jake Hofman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jmh/), I collaborated with scientists at the [Microsoft Research Lab in New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/) to apply machine learning techniques to assess CitiBike's impact on NYC. Most recently, at Capital Normal University, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Hongxiao Wang](https://ams.cnu.edu.cn/english/People/Faculty/ac9b3be8d87a449a963c1d6171def754.htm), where my research focused on enhancing segmentation accuracy for small abdominal organs using machine learning models.

Eager to connect with professionals and peers in technology, research, and innovation, I welcome opportunities for collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Feel free to connect!

I am eager to find a Research Assistant position in the field of NLP, ML, or other related areas. Please feel free to contact me: [xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu](javascript:copyToClipboard('xuyinuo@seas.upenn.edu')).
