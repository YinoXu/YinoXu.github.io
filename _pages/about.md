I'm a Master's student in Computer and Information Science from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Joanna Klukowska](https://cs.nyu.edu/dynamic/people/faculty/joanna-klukowska/) of [NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), New York University. I was advised by [Prof. Silvia Espinosa GÃºtiez](https://www.math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/silvia.html) from [NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cims.nyu.edu/), New York University.
