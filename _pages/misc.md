## 🌊 My Hometown: Qingdao

I was raised in **Qingdao (青岛)**, a beautiful coastal city in eastern China. Known for its red-roofed houses, European-style architecture, and sea breeze, it’s where my love for the ocean and slow-paced life began.

## 🎶 My Favorite Artist: Lana Del Rey

Since middle school, I’ve been deeply drawn to the cinematic melancholy and poetic storytelling of **Lana Del Rey**. Her music evokes both nostalgia and dreaminess, which resonates with many moments in my life. Over the years, I’ve collected many of her **vinyl records**, and they remain some of my most cherished possessions.

## 📷 Stories: Film Camera & Life

I’m also a **beginner film camera collector and hobbyist**. I love how film captures imperfections, shadows, and quiet details that digital often misses. Whether it’s a friend laughing under sunlight or a blurry café street in the rain, my cameras help me freeze time in its most delicate form.

## 🌟 Why I Keep These Things

Whether it's Lana’s music or film photography, I find peace in slow and intentional experiences. These little passions help me remember who I am outside of academics and research — and they inspire me to approach even technical work with creativity and emotion.

Thanks for stopping by this little corner of my world 💫
